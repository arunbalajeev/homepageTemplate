<tr><td width="500px">The School where I entered as a toddler and came out as a major. The confusion of what I learnt these 14 years ached till I saw the outside world which made me recognize the failure to understand the basic values that I learnt here. I dreamt as a child by motivation of teachers to introspect within myself so as to continuously keep improving and to inspire others into making a difference. My education so far has instilled in me the motivation to stay firm in my belief - a trait which lend credence to my dreams </td>
